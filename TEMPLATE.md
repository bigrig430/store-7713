# Template: Native app (Expo)

A real phone app, written in React Native with Expo. The user runs it on their
own phone in the free **Expo Go** app, and the same code is also a website at
this app's address. It is a working app to build ON, not a placeholder.

## What's already built and wired (do NOT rebuild it)

```
app/_layout.tsx   the app's frame (Expo Router: every file in app/ is a screen)
app/index.tsx     the first screen: a working list that loads and saves through the server
components/WakingScreen.tsx  what the app shows while its server wakes up (see below)
lib/api.ts        how every screen talks to the server (use it, never bare fetch)
server.js         the app's server: your JSON API, the phone updates, the website
lib/store.js      durable JSON storage for the server, atomic writes
lib/auth.js       accounts for the app's users: sign up, log in, session tokens
app.json          the app's name, icon and settings
package.json      dependencies and the platform's build marker (do not remove it)
```

## How this app gets to the phone

- **You never build or run it here.** Never run `expo start`, `expo run`,
  `npm install`, `npx expo install` or `expo export` in this workspace. There
  are no `node_modules` here on purpose. The platform installs and builds on
  **Deploy** (about a minute), then the phone picks up the new version.
- **Your first build publishes itself.** The platform deploys it right after
  your reply, so end that turn with what you built and never tell them to tap
  Deploy. After that, a Deploy is the only way a change reaches the phone or
  the website: every edit, even one line in a screen, needs one.
- **The platform hands them the phone link.** Its first-build message carries
  it (a page that opens the free Expo Go app, or helps install it), so don't
  repeat it in your reply; if they ask later, it is in AGENTS.md. After a later
  deploy, tell them to close the app in Expo Go and open it again to load the
  new version.
- **What you can verify:** the website (a screenshot of this app's address
  shows the same screens). You cannot see the phone; the user checks it in
  Expo Go.

## Platform contracts (do not change)

- `package.json` `"vibekit": {"build": "expo"}` and the `build` script. They
  are how the platform knows to build this as a phone app.
- `server.js`'s `/.vibekit/expo/*` handling, `currentRelease()` and `/health`.
  Expo Go loads the app from there; `/health` is how the platform knows the
  server is up.
- `lib/api.ts`'s `Accept: application/json` header and its waking retry, and
  the waking screen in `app/_layout.tsx` (`components/WakingScreen.tsx`). When
  nobody has used the app for a while its server sleeps, and waking takes up
  to a minute; `api()` waits that out while the frame covers every screen with
  the platform's waking message, then removes it the moment the server
  answers. Screens need nothing for it. Restyle `WakingScreen` to match the
  app if you like, but keep what it shows. Bare `fetch` would fail instead.
- `dist/` belongs to the platform (each build lands in `dist/releases/`).
  Never write into it.

## Adding a package

Only packages that run in Expo Go work, and the lockfile must match, so never
edit `package.json` dependencies by hand. Ask the platform to add one (see
TOOLS.md). A hand edit fails the next Deploy with "use the deps action".

## Where things go

| Adding | Put it in |
|---|---|
| A screen | a new file in `app/` (`app/settings.tsx` is `/settings`) |
| Talking to the server | `api()` from `lib/api.ts` |
| An API endpoint | the `routes` table in `server.js` |
| Saved data | `lib/store.js` via `store.read` / `store.write`, in `server.js` |
| Accounts | the `/api/auth/*` routes (already there) and `auth.userFor(req)` |
| A secret or API key | `process.env` in `server.js` only; screens ship inside the app |
| AI (a chat, a coach, a writer) | a `server.js` route that calls the built-in model (TOOLS.md §Runtime AI); screens call that route |
| An icon | `@expo/vector-icons`, one set per import: `import Ionicons from '@expo/vector-icons/Ionicons'` |
| Something to tap | a `Pressable` with `accessibilityRole="button"` (or `"link"`), plus `accessibilityLabel` when it shows only an icon. Without a role it is a plain box to VoiceOver and to the platform's page checks, which then find nothing to tap |
| The app's name and icon | `app.json` (`expo.name`, `expo.icon`) |

`lib/*.js` files run on the server (Node); `.ts`/`.tsx` files run on the phone
and in the browser. Never import a server file from a screen.
